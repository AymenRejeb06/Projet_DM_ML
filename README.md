# Projet_DM_ML
In this project I used a dataset containing informations about Covid19 cases in Tunisia.
Dataset Donwload link :https://www.kaggle.com/ghassen1302/coronavirus-tunisia
The project aims to display Covid case in each city, the age of each, the country coming from in case he was a foreigner and his location in real time
It also aims to split cases depending on their age, If > 60 is considered as a danger else is considered as a stable case.
And finally predict the number of cases in future and in which region.
